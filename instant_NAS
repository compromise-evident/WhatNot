Your computer

Paste this command in "Startup Applications", then restart:
sh -c "python3 -m http.server 8000 -d ~/Public"



NAS computer
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Paste this command in "Startup Applications", replace "hostname" with the hostname of YOUR computer, then restart:
sh -c "while :; do wget -m -np -N -R 'index.html*' hostname.local:8000/; sleep 10; done"















Minimalist NAS without systemd. Drop files & folders in your Public folder and
they'll be saved by this NAS--a normal computer with a normal operating system.

NEVER run the "http.server" commands on public WiFi or on networks you don't trust!
http.server means you should NEVER use this NAS to save sensitive data, but only backups that
you wouldn't mind a judge reading through. Use ethernet cables rather than WiFi to improve privacy.
Here's how it works:



YOUR COMPUTER
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
       python3 -m http.server 8000                  opens your computer's files your network, like home WiFi. (Only those who are connected to your WiFi can see those files.)
       python3 -m http.server 8000 -d ~/Public      opens ONLY your Public folder to the local network. (Again, only those who are connected to your WiFi can see that folder.) This is the line used by this NAS tool!
sh -c "python3 -m http.server 8000 -d ~/Public"     wrapping things in sh -c "" turns it into a program.



NAS COMPUTER
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
while :; do wget -m -np -N -R 'index.html*' hostname.local:8000/; sleep 10; done
This line keeps downloading from the URL "hostname.local:8000". You can visit that URL in a browser and see
everything and download manually if you want. Files & folders are saved to "/home/user/hostname.local:8000".
