/*          The proof of the persistence of predeterminate
                 nature in highly curated simulations



                      -Predeterminate nature of undisturbed simulations-

[ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]     Consider the simulation of the miniature two-dimensional
[ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]     grid universe where the laws of its nature may require the
[ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]     existing center square to paint the nearby squares given a
[ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]     set of simple if-statements, and the resulting new squares
[ ][ ][ ][ ][X][ ][ ][ ][ ]     are set into motion as well. Using the center square as the
[ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]     initial conditions of that universe, the simulation is
[ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]     reproducible and each event is predetermined. Any complex
[ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]     entities may arise in the simulation as "symbols of interest"
[ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]     and claim they have chosen one thing over another, however,
                                they have only classified the other "choice" as an alternative.
This is what makes the entities feel as if they have the freedom of will and control over their
environment. These entities only have the complexity to imagine the other alternatives yet
their universe is not simulated to favor those alternatives for that event in the progression
of information. At the same time, all of these progression events and the imagination and
classification of alternatives were predetermined to arise in the simulation since the
beginning. And if only the minuscule detail of initial conditions being a center square is
enough to duplicate that universe, then so is enough any copy of the simulation stages.

                   -Predeterminate nature of highly curated simulations-

    So far, universe duplication requires a copy at any condition. A universe curated amid its
evolution requires a copy at any condition within its undisturbed continuation. It is possible
to pause the grid universe and manipulate its information to your liking. Manipulations are not
limited to recursion, self reference, external environments, changing the direction of some
entity, or asking it questions through the symbolic restructuring of its environment. However,
in doing so, your simulation is then set into motion again using the new conditions. These
conditions can be used to reproduce the exact same universe unless the conditions are changed
again through some external disturbance, meaning the complex entities will always appear to
"choose" the same thing without the possibility of free will. This is applicable to artificial
intelligence whose environment and conditions can be the current observable universe which if
simulated, results will never change. Whatever the size or conditions of some universe, its
underlying particles--obeying the laws of their nature--will continue their predictable journey
hence the persistence of predeterminate nature.
