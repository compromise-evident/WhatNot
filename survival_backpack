Justification

316 stainless steel uninsulated water bottle
* Good creep resistance.
* Set on ash/flame and boil lidless.
* Endures cycle heating of up to 870C.

* Endures carbide precipitation of 425C - 870C.
* Endures many chlorides, acids, and alkalis.
* 2-layer thermos may creep before boiling water.
* If you can find one mirror-finished and annealed, get it.

Forged full-tang hatchet
* Blade & handle forged as one (fiberglass and wooden handles are a joke.)
* You may want an 18in hatchet--short enough to quickly swing at lions, and long enough to fell trees.
* If you can find a forged full-tang Pulaski axe, get it; dig ore/frozen earth & move rocks.

Binoculars
* Spot prey.
* Spot predators.
* Spot resources.
* Much better viewing than monocular.
* Better wide-scanning than spotting scope.
* Spotting scopes with usable eye piece are 400 bucks.
* Has depth perception compared to monocular and spotting scope.
* Get 10x50 for comfy viewing, clarity, depth perception, wide scanning, & low light.

* Configure the neck strap right away; binoculars should be carried with quick access!

* Extra neck, side, and ear protection.

Sun hat
* Prevent heat stroke.
