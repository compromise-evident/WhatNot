Justifiable source/bin obfuscation;

Secret key agreement over any network
- Generate a private binary string.
- I'll send you an obfuscated executable
  for printing your string reordered.
- Send me the resulting string.
- I'll restore its order.

Verify key owner without decrypting
- You claim it's your ciphertext.
- I'll send you an obfuscated executable
  which prints my string if and only if
  your input key decrypts your ciphertext
  already embedded in my executable.
- Send me hash of the resulting string.
- I'll compare it to my string's hash.
