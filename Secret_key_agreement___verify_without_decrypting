Justifiable source & bin obfuscation;

Establish secret key over public network
- Generate a private binary string.
- I'll send you obfuscated executable
­ ­  for printing your string reordered.
- Send me the resulting string.
- I'll restore the string order.

Verify key owner without decrypting
- You claim it's your ciphertext.
- I'll send you obfuscated executable
­ ­  for printing my string if and only if
­ ­  your input key decrypts the ciphertext.
- Send me a hash of my resulting string.
- I'll compare it to my hash of my string.
