Justifiable source/bin obfuscation;

Secret key agreement over any network
- Generate a private binary string.
- I'll send you an obfuscated executable
  for printing your string reordered.
- Send me the resulting string.
- I'll restore its order.

Verify key owner without decrypting
- You claim it's your ciphertext.
- I'll send you an executable for
  printing my string if and only if
  your input key decrypts that ciphertext
  (embedded in my obfuscated executable.)
- Send me a hash of the resulting string.
- I'll compare it to my hash.
