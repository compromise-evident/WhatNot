There exist 3 well-meaning use cases
for obfuscating source and executables;


Establish secret key over public network
- Alice generates disposable private
  binary data.
- Bob sends Alice disposable obfuscated
  executable to print her data reordered.
- Alice sends Bob the resulting data.
- Bob restores the data order.


Verify key owner without decrypting
- Alice sends Bob a disposable public
  ciphertext.
- Bob sends Alice disposable obfuscated
  executable to print his secret if her
  input key decrypts the ciphertext.


Verify RSA key owner without p or q
- Ditto, except ciphertext is a semiprime.
  (Especially useful if you had factored
  RSA-260+ and wish to prove it, without
  yet disclosing p or q.)
