Feb 28 2023   Used raw.githubusercontent.com/compromise-evident/WhatNot/main/Pulling_my_tooth.jpg
              to attempt to pull my big tooth. It crackled like they said it would--
              freeing itself of some attachments. But it became painful so I paused
              for the day. It's bearable after a short while and I'll return to
              the cycle of wiggling it around until it's too painful again.
              Freeing it of attachments like this should make it less painful
              over time. (For the final pull, I'll rinse with salt/chemicals.)
              I don't know what the fuck I'm doing. I hope to be helpful.
              The best part is there was never any blood, or any need to poke
              into the gums. Slowly but surely...

Feb 28 2023   After 1 hour, I experienced and unusual lack of pain motherfucker!
              I may not need to finish pulling it, and save it for chewing instead.
              I'll see how it feels tomorow. Perhaps snapping those neural strings
              was all I needed, or maybe I'll snap a few more tomorow... I'm just
              sure as fuck about it not hurting as much next time because I've
              already snapped a few...
