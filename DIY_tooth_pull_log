Feb 28 2023   Used raw.githubusercontent.com/compromise-evident/WhatNot/main/Pulling_my_tooth.jpg
              to attempt to pull my big tooth. It crackled like they said it would--
              freeing itself of some attachments. But it became painful so I paused
              for the day. It's bearable after a short while and I'll return to
              the cycle of wiggling it around until it's too painful again.
              Freeing it of attachments like this should make it less painful
              over time. (For the final pull, I'll rinse with salt/chemicals.)
              I don't know what the fuck I'm doing. I hope to be helpful.
              The best part is there was never any blood, or any need to poke
              into the gums. Slowly but surely...

Next entry soon...
