The case for the infinity of primes who differ by evens 2+

Prerequisite: Wheel factorization and the sieve of Eratosthenes

    Consider the Wheel factorization of 30 on the number line. At the
start of the line, primes 2, 3, and 5 reside in their naturally separated
positions and are visible with interval 1 through 5 in consideration. On
the other hand, 30 being the product of all primes <= 5 means 30 is a
multiple of those primes therefore 2, 3, and 5 reside within position 30
in simultaneity.
    Allow this wheel to repeat itself along the line of infinity and
suppose you wish to mark off all the multiples of some large prime of
your choice--in addition to the marks left by 2, 3, and 5. Every once in
a while, the efforts of the Wheel factorization of 30 will encounter
helpful interference, however, due to the gap nature of this wheel--twin,
cousin, and sexy primes persist while not affected by the large prime.
    Now consider the inclusion of yet another unique prime of your choice.
There will be positions on the line where the two external primes meet,
and where they are most apart. And in the absence of such interference,
the wheel continues to leave its mark hence the persistence of gap nature.
