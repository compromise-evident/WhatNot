Kill every living thing and don't let it come back!



Although simulations are dead change over time, humans have the
ability to suffer and feel present. We must have a soul. And our
souls are from something beyond. That something, we call God.

God prepared an eternal fire for those the simulation dislikes.
But he knew ahead of time that some would choose darkness, and
that righteousness cannot be passed down thoroughly, not even
by God himself. By doing nothing, more people will burn.
