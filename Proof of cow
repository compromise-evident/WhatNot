/*  Today's prescription is for those who can't afford to lose a cow.
Let me remind the internet that just as some three-letter agency owns the
face you make on defecation, third-world thieves are stuffing cows into the
back seat, often times fooling the local sub-border animal control.
 
 
        Introducing Authorship - infinite authentication tool. The following
batteries are not included: cow ledger system, biological cow ID system.
What's in the box? Authorship.cpp - a Command Line Interface to all the
math you need for this project, with three independent options:
 
1. Get Authorship number
2. Modify Authorship number
3. Verify number modification

        Currently, some regions in Africa are experimenting with existing
core systems with the same exact requirements of BTC and ETH - an exhaustive
race between highly-active proofs of work and system-wide acceptance of the
superior blockchain.
        Authorship on the other hand can operate smoothly where system-wide
dead-silence lasts for arbitrary periods of time and old modification
information can be discarded immediately after successful verification.
This is good for minimal, low-resource, and localized animal control where
each individial user eventually or immediately performs verification for
each and every proof of cow.
        I'll end with a note from the red team on generating cow IDs: it can't
be too convenient for the owner, and too inconvenient for animal control.
Let's say the ID system requires a quick image of the animal's nose for its
highly-wrinkled nature. Then what's to stop me from taking a quick selfie
with your cow and falsifying its ownership? Now you can't register your own
cow since diplicate IDs may be denied. */
