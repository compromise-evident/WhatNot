FAQ

* Big tech companies are insecure about their methods, what makes you different?
  Independent verification means those who excel in domains you do not--can show
  you flaws privately, before those flaws are used by someone anonymous. Authors
  of proprietary software are either claiming they alone excel in all domains,
  or have malicious features implemented willingly or against their will.

* Your math checks out, but what about the C++?
  Read my C++ guide: github.com/compromise-evident/hello/blob/main/hello.cpp
  Once you memorize a few things, you'll quickly recognize them as you audit my programs.

* Do you accept code contributions?
  Not a single line, not a single character. Contact me if you're auditing.
