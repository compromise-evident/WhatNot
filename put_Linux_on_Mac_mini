After installing Devuan onto a Mac mini, boot live into it with a separate Devuan USB stick and do:
wget https://sourceforge.net/projects/refind/files/latest/download -O refind-bin-0.14.2.zip
Decompress file "refind-bin-0.14.2.zip".
Open folder "refind-bin-0.14.2".
Right-click and open terminal here.
sudo ./refind-install
Shut down and boot normally.
Log in as root and change timeout from 20 to -1 in file: /boot/efi/EFI/refind/refind.conf
Reboot (you need not do this again upon reinstalling Devuan.)



(Tested on a late 2012 Mac mini.)
