    n/d_1 ... n/d_2 ... n/d_3 ... n/d_4 ... n/d_5 ... n/d_6 ... n/d_7 ...

  Suppose d_2 is the number of possible images or pixel combinations for some
file size where d_2 represents the denominator of the second dimension--where
images exist. d_2 is calculated by taking the number of possible pixel states
and raising it to the power of total pixels.  From there, we can easily morph
into the first dimension by sharing our numerator value. This is no different
than passing our current state of the universe. And the first dimension being
a single spatial point on the number line, its new values may fluctuate as we
continue passing the states of our simulation within our flat image-universe.
  Now let's morph into a higher dimension from the second. We can perform the
same operation and pass along our numerator, and the only thing changing will
be the denominators  who grow in size to help store additional aspects of the
same universe.  As you observe higher and higher dimensions, you will see the
same 3D cube of the same size embedded  within all dimensions three or higher
where spatial entities are simulated, however, the sub-regions on top of that
represent the current state of aspects and principles of that simulation. Any
visual representation of d_3 may appear chaotic,  fluctuating dramatically as
smooth changes take place in d_2, however, d_3 is allowed to exist--as random
as it may look. Simulating only d_3 from that point is like simulating a mess
of energy on Earth where the particles settle down and gain order.  It is now
that smooth simulation of this order translates into chaotic fluctuations for
d_2 and any other dimension. Like the strange illusions of time and distance,
dimensions can be data structures--each capable of absorbing the same value.*/
