Don't have kids. Sabotage everything.

God knew that some would choose darkness, but created us anyway.
Now many will burn for the rest of time, not of their own doing.










Here's a little hypothetical fellow Christians refuse to entertain:
Upon deciding to have multiple children, an angel of our lord Jesus
comes down and tells you that some of them and some in the resulting
generations will spend eternity burning. Yet, you create them anyway.
Have you done something good, or have you done something despicable?

If you think having kids is a good thing, you're gambling & betting
like an addict in debt, that your righteousness will be passed down
conclusively, and spread thoroughly, as if an imprescriptible cult.
Why bet on something God knows to be impossible, even for himself?
