1. $10 portable bench grinder bit: quarter-inch quick-attachment to drill, for holding a stone wheel meant for bench-grinders. Quickly sharpen drill bits on the job.

2. Highly maintainable vehicle: front bumper opens like a house door and holds the radiators and fans. You can walk right into the timing belt in 4 seconds.

3. Space shield testing in the style of Elon Musk: hyper-velocity labs charge too much for only a few projectiles launched against space shield material, due to slow
   reloading times and cost of fancy materials. I bet there's a way to rapidly reuse that long squeeze-gun and to set up fully automatic imaging systems who send media
   directly to the customer over the internet. Customers can retrieve their shields, or be charged to have us manage recycling and disposal.
