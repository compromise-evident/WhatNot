/*   Booting into the heads live operating system which sends all traffic through
Tor by default. heads comes with basic tools including the Tor browser which gives
you secure and anonymous access to the internet as well as the unfiltered internet
(dark web.) heads provides a temporary computer session without leaving a trace.
heads contains a fully de-blobbed kernel hardened with grsecurity. This systemd-free
Devuan derivative is completely libre and free as in freedom. 32/64, ships with links.


Making heads for Windows users:
	1. Insert spare flash drive.
	2. Download heads from heads.dyne.org then
	   download LiLi (Linux Live USB Creator.)
	3. Use LiLi to format the flash drive with input:
	   heads download, and output: flash drive.

Making heads for Linux users (root):
	lsblk
	dd if=/home/nikolay/Downloads/heads-0.4-i386-live.iso of=/dev/sdb
	
	(The lsblk command stands for list block, it lists available drives and
	their partitions in a branching format. "sda" is usually the main drive,
	look for the name corresponding to the flash drive or its size. For example:
	"sdb 16GB storage." "sdb" would be the destination name unless it's your
	internal secondary drive. In that case, the USB would show up as "sdc."
	Do not format sda unless you know what you're doing! And of course,
	replace the example user name "nikolay" with the user name on your machine.)

Using heads:
	Warning: avoid computers with connected USB drives and physical
	key loggers (USB device interjecting keyboard & computer usually
	at rear ports.) Do not bring smartphones/connective/logging devices.
	Public computer monitoring may get red flags when machines go offline.
	
	1. Insert flash drive with the computer off.
	   (This prevents virus contraction, however, the flash drive ID, details,
	   and insert time is logged and sent to the on-board storage device even if
	   you only entered the boot menu! If the on-board storage device is encrypted,
	   the logs are later applied to that drive's OS once decrypted by the owner.)
	2. Power it on and press the F12 key until boot menu appears.
	   (Keyboard key for boot menu appears at startup and is usually F12.)
	3. Use arrow keys to select the flash drive and press enter.
	   (Flash drive should show up as "Sandisk Ultra 16GB" for example.)

Other information:
	* Your session is contained within the system RAM, pull the power plug in emergencies.
	* Use a VPN to mask the fact that you're using Tor and for added security. Avoid VPNs
	  operated by news groups and those producing side applications other than VPN systems.
	* An extra precaution is to compare a hash of your heads download with the heads hash displayed
	  on the heads website. A hash mismatch means you did not receive the intended file, discard it.
	* Modern flash and SSD devices come with more memory than is displayed and when written to, do not
	  immediately overwrite data marked for deletion. This increases device life-span while undermining
	  security. “Encrypt & replace file” does not explicitly mean the unencrypted version is overwritten
	  when you completely flood device memory. Encrypt device format beforehand or encrypt data on a
	  separate device whose memory can be demolished effectively without the chance of reverse and recovery.
	* Once the Tor browser is opened, you can search for links to the dark web. These links can only be
	  processed using the Tor browser. A less secure layer of the internet called the deep web consists
	  of regular web pages that have not been indexed--those pages do not show up in search engines.
	* If there's a hold-up on package delivery for example, you are not to pick it up in person.
	  The package is a loss if illegal.
