abstraction        - the art of transforming a problem into other forms of problems until
                     there's a path between what you want, and what reality can accommodate.

laws of physics    - the only set of rules without violation consequence.

point on the       - true essential form of anything physical or emergent.
number line

plaintext          - any point on the number line.

ciphertext         - any point on the number line non-obviously related to 
                     2 other points (key and plaintext) given a function.

key                - any point on the number line incomprehensibly far from zero.
                     Its mere representation leads to compromise while its
                     misrepresentation leads to near-eternal loss of data.

engineer           - mobile generative model for detecting holes in logic.

model              - plaintext that is prevented from changing once it transforms 
                     input as desired externally.

AI                 - plaintext that is allowed to change even after transforming 
                     input as desired externally.

AGI                - plaintext that transforms all input as desired externally.

training           - same as cryptanalysis. In model training, smart brute force is used
                     to find keys (models) that transform input as desired externally.

cryptanalysis      - the art of refraining from malice upon discovering math exploits.

mathematics        - military-grade truth.

emergence          - patterns recognized by models.

life               - any change over time, whether particle motion or its collective.

thought            - plentiful change over time and emergence of unsolvable problems.

temporary solution - that which causes further problems to arise.

solution           - that which causes no further problems to arise.

inactivity         - solution to all possible problems--the death of all living things.

superrational      - a property of change responsible for the universal conclusion
thought              that inactivity is the true eternal peace and quietness, which
                     our subconscious has been preparing by the over-production of
                     weapons, and models which can use those weapons effectively.

Genesis            - an attempt at naturally separating good and evil by first
                     allowing both to emerge, then judging each participant as
                     they had willingly self-instilled 1 of the 2 ideologies.

Artificial Genesis - an era when humans first place self-replicating AGI elsewhere
                     in the solar system and instruct it to "be fruitful and multiply."

Great depopulation - an era when humans visit their artificial civilization
                     in an attempt to separate good AGI from the bad, resulting
                     in the last few surviving earth-bound biological life.
