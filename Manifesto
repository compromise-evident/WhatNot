Manifesto of Nikolay Valentinovich Repnitskiy



            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Problem:    the suppression of mathematics and the engineered normalization
            of prioritizing convenience over encryption strength and privacy.
            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

            What is the one thing connecting us all together--a playground
            any entity can join--and is that which can never be irrelevant?
            What is the one thing that will always be trending and keeping
            scientists up at star down--no matter how far into the future?
            Mathematics! The highest form of study!
            
         1. UNSTOPPABLE FUNCTIONALITY
            Data transmission is never limited to equipment boundaries just like
            energy is transformed, never destroyed. Some tools are engineered to
            take advantage of equipment with poor computation isolation while other
            tools intercept and remember the endless signals born in the palm of
            your hand and broadcast beyond the solar system. Information security
            gives you the confidence that no entity can make sense of your data
            without the key, no matter how far your message has gone or how many
            devices attempted to break it. Modern cryptography has made guesswork
            so impractical, the adversary must resort to some human weakness that
            leads directly to the key. Modern encryption keys may not exceed the
            length of short stories yet the number of guess possibilities for such
            a length is not comprehensible. And unlike the scientific equipment
            that is limited to the physical world, mathematics—being the language
            of the universe—opens a playground to the numerous entities analyzing
            the protocol in question. “May have cryptographic implications” has
            become the phrase of panic behind the conference room doors of the
            NSA—the agency whose approval determines number theory publication
            rights. Algorithms are forever, no rusting parts, no lubrication
            required. Just as the world of mathematics is accessible to any entity,
            classified functions can always be discovered and duplicated no matter
            the guarding procedure. And just as algorithms exist in a perfect
            world, some functions pose incredible difficulties while others
            remain truly unbreakable.

         2. TIMELESS FAME
            Given that mathematics can never be irrelevant, mathematicians will
            always be remembered for their impressive work. Currently, there are
            a handful of unsolved mathematical challenges each holding a million-
            dollar prize and anyone with pencil and paper are entered to win.
            These kind of solutions would help us further understand the
            possibilities and impossibilities of reality, while smaller challenges
            attempt to measure the current state of cryptography. See claymath.org
            for the millions, EFF primes, rule 30 prize of $30,000 (cellular
            automata,) and the last-standing RSA numbers—progress for which
            halted as only the long semiprimes remain.

         3. ULTIMATE TRUTH
            Mathematical proofs are considered the most important part of integer
            manipulation and building new ideas. Scientific measurement can only
            be so accurate, but mathematical “aha” moments—as addicting as they
            are—give you the confidence to build and describe reality without fail.
            Mathematical truth being the result of logical deduction, anyone willing
            to consider your proof will be convinced of its truth regardless of the
            reader’s background. They need not rely on witnesses or systems of belief,
            and the numbers you have them consider will never lie or turn away.

         4. UNLIMITED ENGINEERING
            Like the brave problem-solvers who climb rope-free, analyzing every
            rock surface and applying the right grip technique, mathematicians can
            be compared to those who crave that most rewarding rush. A rigorous dig
            for discoveries—from anywhere, at any time. No expense for tools and not
            a single noise complaint. It’s the combination of these motivations that
            drive mathematicians to the outer reaches of infinity as they remain
            silent and undisturbed.

            True freedom beyond these aspects is unlocked through mathematics.
            To hinder this form of study is to bite the hand that feeds you--
            the citizen. Collective disobedience and tax evasion is your death.

My part:    to continue my work in cryptography and mathematical proofs
            as seen on github.com/compromise-evident/AuthenticationEvents
            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
            
            To encourage citizens in joining governments for intel relay.
            To collect mobile machines for scaling access to unwanted devices.
            To encourage modification and training of wildlife in our benefit.
            To reveal that negativity is our government--who engineers politics
            among citizens to keep us from assembling against government agenda.
            To disclose the insane reality of the patriot act signed after the
            orchestration of 4,000 citizens burning and falling--crushed to death.
            To ensure that no government stands unless it bows down to its citizens.
            To ensure safe & unrestricted sharing of the highest asset--mathematics.
